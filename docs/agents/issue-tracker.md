# Issue tracker: GitHub

Issues and PRDs for this repo live as GitHub issues. Use the `gh` CLI for all operations.

## Conventions

- **Create an issue**: `gh issue create --title "..." --body "..."`. Use a heredoc for multi-line bodies.
- **Read an issue**: `gh issue view <number> --comments`, including labels.
- **List issues**: `gh issue list --state open --json number,title,body,labels,comments`, with appropriate label and state filters.
- **Comment on an issue**: `gh issue comment <number> --body "..."`
- **Apply / remove labels**: `gh issue edit <number> --add-label "..."` / `--remove-label "..."`
- **Close**: `gh issue close <number> --comment "..."`

Infer the repository from `git remote -v`; `gh` does this automatically when run inside a clone.

## Pull requests as a triage surface

Run `gh issue view <number> --comments`.

## Wayfinding operations

Use a single GitHub issue as the map and child issues as decision tickets. Prefer GitHub sub-issues and native issue dependencies. If either feature is unavailable, use a task list in the map and a `Blocked by: #<n>` line in child issues. A ticket is ready only when all blockers are closed.
